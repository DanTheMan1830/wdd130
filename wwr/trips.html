                <p>The trip will begin with breakfast provided, and you'll meet your guide for the
                    ride.
                    They'll provide a brief orientation, instructing you on how to raft & on safety.
                    We will then transport all rafters to the starting location, where we will
                    receive
                    equipment. After one last safety brief from our guide, you'll venture down the
                    river
                    towards the beautiful scenery.
                    Lunch will be provided midway through the ride as directed. After the ride, we
                    will
                    collect all equipment.
                </p>

                <p>The ride through the local river is anticipated to take about 5-6 hours. All
                    rafters must
                    be at least 14 years of age.
                    Anyone under 18 is required to have a guardian. We recommend that clients should
                    be
                    reasonably confident in the water,
                    but it isn't required to know how to swim.<br><br>
                    Equipment such as lifejackets, rafts, and paddles will be provided on site. We
                    recommend
                    bringing towels and/or changes
                    of clothes as desired.
