                <p>Growing up, my father would often take me and my brothers on nature trips as a
                    bonding experience.
                    I look back on these times as the period of time where I got to truly learn
                    strength, grow as a
                    person.
                    I started this company because I saw an opportunity to provide these experiences
                    with others.
                    As a company, we are committed to providing only the highest quality of service
                    for families or
                    groups looking to get the most out of their time.</p>
